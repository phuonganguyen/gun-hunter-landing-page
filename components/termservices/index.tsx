            Risk Disclosure GunHunterNFT. is not a registered broker, analyst, investment advisor or
            intending to offer any financial advice or guidance. Everything that we provide on the
            Platforms is purely for informational and educational purposes only and should not be
            relied upon as investment advice or the most up-to-date information. All information
            contained herein should be independently verified and confirmed. GunHunterNFT. is not
            liable for any loss or damage whatsoever caused in reliance upon such information or
            services. Please be aware of the risks involved with any trading done in any financial
            market. Do not trade with money that you cannot afford to lose, when in doubt, you
            should consult a qualified financial advisor before making any investment decisions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Disclaimer Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies (also called digital or virtual
            currencies, crypto assets, altcoins, etc) involves substantial risk of loss and is not
            suitable for every investor. The valuation of cryptocurrencies and futures may
            fluctuate, and, as a result, clients may lose more than their original investment. The
            highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a
            great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large
            losses or can work for you, leading to large gains.
            <br />
            If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount
            you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial
            resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading
            unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the
            extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must
            seek independent advice from your financial advisor.
            <br />
            <br />
            All trading strategies are used at your own risk.

            CFTC rule 4.41 – hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations.
            unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading.
            Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over
            compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of
            liquidity. simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they
            are designed with the benefit of hindsight.

            No representation is being made that your performance will or is likely to achieve
            profit or losses similar to those shown.
